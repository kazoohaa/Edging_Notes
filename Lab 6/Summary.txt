Summary

1. This system uses MQTT for communication between a webcam node and a laptop node. The webcam node listens for image capture requests and sends captured images as base64-encoded data. The laptop node requests image captures every 10 seconds and saves the received images to disk.

2. The Webcam Node captures and transmits images upon request via MQTT.

3. The Laptop Node listens for image data, decodes it, and saves it to a file. Additionally, it sends capture requests every 10 seconds to trigger image capture from the webcam node.

This setup demonstrates a basic, MQTT-based system for capturing and transmitting images in a distributed system using Paho MQTT and OpenCV.
